This CNC was designed using FreeCAD program:

Open the file Design/my_first_cnc.fcstd to see the complete
CNC machine.

Inside Design/Parts_FreeCAD/ you will find the CNC pieces that
were designed on FreeCAD and also the 2D design of parts you
will need to mill first to create your own CNC.

This project is based on Mogens Nicolaisen's CNC Router:

IMPORTANT NOTE: The ballnut_holder parts were based on the
ballnut housing I bought from eBay. I noticed they don't
have the exact same dimension. So, you need to double check
it before milling your ballnut_holders.
